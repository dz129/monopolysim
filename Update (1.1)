Just updated the code to where it can automatically play games. HOWEVER, TRADING IS CURRENTLY REMOVED. The trading feature is extremely buggy and causes segmentation faults on every run. This will be fixed in the future.

I also made small updates to the python script (it's still bare bones), it wasn't reading data correctly before because of a couple logic errors but not it works fine.
Also, the data now spans 100000 pieces of data on color and properties with 350 games being played by the computer. Here are the stats:

Brown Percent: 0.07404446357738077
Light Blue Percent: 0.13272962086036716
Pink Percent: 0.1291319455121306
orange Percent: 0.16334061068232833
red Percent: 0.15016450908643644
yellow Percent: 0.14084745241536237
green Percent: 0.13655791642323423
blue Percent: 0.07318348144276006
Player1 percentage win: 0.335243553008596
Player2 percentage win: 0.29512893982808025
Player3 percentage win: 0.36962750716332377

I am going to add a data reading feature that targets the best properties to buy (not just color). Also I'm probably going to learn SQL to display such data in the future. But right now, I have barebones versions of both the data processing script as well as the simulator.

SMALL NOTE: The simulator encounters an infinite loop at times, I'm working on finding the root cause of that but right now, just CTRL + C to stop the infinite loop
